1. Set up the basic MLX42 structure first:

Initialize MLX42 window and image buffer
Set up the main game loop
Test that you can display something simple (like a colored screen)
Implement basic keyboard input handling (ESC to quit, WASD/arrows)

2. Convert player data from parsing:

Take the t_config structure from your friend
Convert player direction char (N/S/E/W) to your rotation angle
Set up player position using the parsed coordinates

3. Port your ray casting algorithm:

Start with a simple version - maybe just cast one ray straight ahead
Adapt your JS Ray class logic to C functions
Test that the ray hits walls correctly

4. Simple wall rendering:

Before textures, just render walls as colored rectangles (like your JS)
Get the 3D projection working with MLX42
Make sure wall heights look correct

5. Then add complexity:

Multiple rays â†’ full FOV
Texture loading and mapping
Proper wall direction detection
